Emma will be 8 this summer. She's interested in robots, art, and being outdoors. Wants to do at least one camp with her friend Maya.

## Planning Priorities

- Include at least one outdoor/nature camp
- Keep last 2 weeks of August free for family time
- Try to coordinate with Maya's schedule for Robotics
- Budget target: ~$2,000 for the summer
