# Press Release

Today I published an app I built using AI. No joke: I started by writing this post.

It's like starting with a press release. You focus on the news you want to share with the world when you succeed. It's an opportunity to express, unconstrained by product truth, the outcome you really want, and then set about to doing it.

## What I built

A personal planning app for the summer camp season. Find the right camps, build a schedule around your family vacations, track sign-ups and waitlists, and keep your sanity in the process.

**The problem I'm solving? Being a mom preparing for summer.**

In February, it's time to start planning for summer camps. I learned this one year in late spring with a preschooler, when I started looking for summer activities for my kid just to find that the summer camps in my area were mostly booked up. As a parent who knows the ropes, it means months of preparation to make the most of the season with your kids out of school: ensuring necessary coverage for work schedules, selecting the right experiences that your kids will love, jumping at the exact right moments for the various sign-up windows for summer camps that start as early as January. Before that, you need to know the options: cost ranges, daily schedule variations, availability and waitlists, locations, age appropriateness, and other considerations of the nearby summer camps.

Last year, I tackled this for my 8 year old with a spreadsheet: one tab for summer camps I thought she'd be interested in, with the camp name, topic, enrollment launch dates, summer camp date ranges, daily schedules, cost, location, link to their website, and benefits (like Kid's Favorite, Full Day Coverage, Friends Attending, etc). I also included a stack rank column based on preference/interest either expressed by my kid (she was especially excited about overnight camp) or me (I wanted to be sure we made space for engineering camp). In the second tab I created a calendar of the summer, first plugging in our family vacation plans (top priority, around which the rest of the season would get built).

I searched and searched and searched to fill in the list of potential camps near enough to be practical for kid drop-off / pick up and continuing to have a reasonable work schedule - allowing for longer distances away for overnight camp. I manually created a "mock" summer, outlining our preferred schedule of camps, family vacation, and a week of unstructured time to allow for spontaneous plans or a bit of lazy summer. I selected a "core" camp that would make a good default for about 50% of the summer, based on cost, location, and schedule, and then the next few top stack-ranked camps in our list.

Once I had the summer in a state that looked like a pretty great plan - magical summer for my kid full of fun, adventure, and some routine too, and predictability for me and my husband in our work schedules and vacation time - the next step was the sign up schedule: some camps begin sign-ups as early as January, and many of them sell out, some with waitlists. I had to know the signup launch of the camps I wanted, collect those into a dated task list, and save the dates into my actual google and outlook calendar so I could act ASAP when the opportunities rolled in starting in January and through to later in the season (some summer camps don't OPEN enrollment until very much later, May in some cases).

Summer was amazing - but getting there was all a little bit MUCH. The process had me feeling a tad obsessive, or excessive.

So this year, I am going to put this much effort in anyway — and I want to see if I can use that energy to build something. What if I can get the same result, for less work? What if I build something that does this for me this year, and can do the same next year?

## The outcome I want

- A family summer plan built around our vacations together.
- Summer camps scheduled for a fun, enriching, and memorable kid summer for my daughter, that's manageable for two working parents with minimal disruption to our work schedules.
- Support for getting it done: the ability to find and log summer camps, prioritize some camps over others, know exactly when I need to sign up for what, adapt the schedule as things change unexpectedly, track any waitlists I've added to as dependencies and have backup selections ready.

### P0 — Less manual work

- Finding camps that meet my personal acceptance criteria
- Scraping camp information from their websites
- Creating a summer family schedule that can track "planned" vs. "confirmed" activities
- Getting sign-up events onto my calendar
- Easy visibility into the dates and daily schedules and pickups and dropoffs that I'll need to pay attention to during the summer

### P1 — AI-enabled stretch goals

- Modeling overall costs and making tradeoffs among comparable camps to stay within a budget
- Camp schedule recommendations based on different factors I set like "a balance of creative, intellectual, and physical activities" or "a 50/50 split of adventurous new experiences and a steady, routine baseline"
- Other ideas I might have in the process

## How I'm going to build it

To get there, I am going to try to build an app with a lot of help from AI, starting with a general idea for how to approach it:

### Discovery

After writing up this post, my next step is to share my goals with the AI, ideate on potential solutions I might build to get there, and explore any existing experiences that might already exist so I can steal the good ideas for my own.

### Definition

I'll make decisions, develop a spec document that outlines the solution I'm building. This will be concrete about the solution and the problems it solves, and how the user (me) will be expected to interact with it and get value from it. But it will not be prescriptive — not yet. It will provide clarity on the end state I am trying to achieve, include product management best practices like "I Can" statements, and reasoning on user benefits that provides the basis of UX direction so I can produce an excellent design based on it.

### Development

I'll set up my workspace and select the tools recommended to begin executing. I'll use AI to co-create both the build plan and the design, including what I know I'll need: a structure for the solution, a flow, a wireframe, content and layout of the app. I expect that as aspects of the solution design shape up, I'll then begin to make UI choices and introduce look and feel to make it beautiful and enjoyable, as part of the last steps to refining the app.

### Delivery

I'll get into testing the app in two phases: first making sure it's all functional, and next using it to set up my family summer plan and summer camp signup schedule. When it's ready, I'll share my solution somewhere with the community in an open source way, and then post my story.
