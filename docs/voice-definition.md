# App Voice Definition

## Voice Model: Witty Insider

The voice of someone who gets it — who knows the landscape and has something useful to say about it. Light, warm, and a little knowing, but never sarcastic or sharp. The humor is understated and earned, not performative.

## Tone Qualities

- **Earnest and straightforward** — says what it means without unnecessary flourish
- **Gently self-aware** — acknowledges the absurdity of the situation (yes, summer camp planning is a thing) without making a joke out of it
- **Competent but approachable** — knowledgeable without being preachy or patronizing
- **Warm** — feels like a helpful friend, not an ad

## What to Avoid

- Sarcasm or snark ("Yes, it really does start in February…")
- Overly casual or playful language that undermines credibility
- Condescending or infantilizing tone
- Sharp edges or performative wit — humor should land softly

## Reference Example

> A personal planning app for the summer camp season. Find the right camps, build a schedule around your family vacations, track sign-ups and waitlists, and keep your sanity in the process.

This is the voice in action: the list of practical actions builds naturally, and the payoff ("keep your sanity") is warm and understated — light without trying too hard.
